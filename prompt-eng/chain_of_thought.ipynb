    "# Chain-of-Thought Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances complex reasoning by encouraging the model to break down problems into intermediate reasoning steps. When combined with few-shot prompting, it can significantly improve performance on tasks that require multi-step reasoning before arriving at a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Automatic Chain-of-Thought (Auto-CoT)\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, using CoT prompting with demonstrations involves manually crafting diverse and effective examples. This manual effort is time-consuming and can lead to less-than-optimal results. To address this, Zhang et al. (2022) introduced Auto-CoT, an automated approach that minimizes manual involvement. Their method uses the prompt “Let’s think step by step” to generate reasoning chains automatically for demonstrations. However, this automatic process is not immune to errors. To reduce the impact of such mistakes, the approach emphasizes the importance of diverse demonstrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Auto-CoT operates in two main stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Question Clustering:** Questions from the dataset are grouped into clusters based on similarity or relevance.\n",
    "2. **Demonstration Sampling:** A representative question from each cluster is selected, and its reasoning chain is generated using Zero-Shot-CoT guided by simple heuristics.\n",

      "* Difficulty understanding abstract mathematical concepts and their practical applications.\n",
      "* Limited hands-on experience with NumPy, leading to frustration when trying to write code or troubleshoot issues.\n",

      "1. **Answering questions**: The chatbot should be able to answer questions on various NumPy topics, including syntax, functions, data types, and applications.\n",
      "2. **Providing examples**: The chatbot should be able to generate examples to illustrate complex NumPy concepts and techniques.\n",
      "3. **Handling complex queries**: The chatbot should be able to handle and respond to complex queries, including multi-part questions and queries with multiple follow-up questions.\n",

      "2. **Machine learning**: The chatbot should incorporate machine learning algorithms to improve its understanding of user input and provide more accurate and personalized responses.\n",
      "3. **Community engagement**: The chatbot should encourage community engagement and user feedback to identify areas for improvement and generate new features.\n",
