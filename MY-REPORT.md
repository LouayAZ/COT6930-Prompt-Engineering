# Research Question 

How can we automate the requirement analysis process to develop an AI-powered chatbot that effectively assists students with Numpy-related queries, thereby enhancing their learning experience?

## Arguments

#### What is already known about this topic

- Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) can streamline the development of chatbots designed to help students with Numpy-related questions.
- The challenges of accurately interpreting and responding to complex mathematical queries posed by students.
- The potential of AI-driven tools to provide real-time assistance and enhance students' learning experiences in computational subjects.

#### What this research is exploring


- We employ a combination of Natural Language Processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to automate the requirement analysis for developing a Numpy-focused chatbot.
- We are building a robust AI-powered chatbot designed to assist students with their Numpy questions, providing instant feedback and resources.
- We are exploring the integration of advanced NLP models like GPT-4omini and beyond to enhance the chatbot's understanding and response accuracy.

#### Implications for practice


- It will be easier to deploy scalable chatbot solutions that can assist a large number of students simultaneously.
- It will optimize the process of answering student queries, reducing the workload on human tutors and educators.
- We will better understand the dynamics of student interaction with AI tools, paving the way for more personalized and effective educational technology solutions.


# Research Method
- Conduct a thorough requirement analysis using existing chatbot frameworks and educational resources.
- Develop a prototype using state-of-the-art NLP models, focusing on accurately interpreting Numpy-related queries.
- Test the chatbot in a controlled environment with a sample of students to gather data on its effectiveness and areas for improvement.
- Iterate on the design and functionality based on feedback and performance metrics.

# Results

Preliminary tests indicate a high rate of accuracy in the chatbot's ability to interpret and respond to Numpy questions.
Students reported increased satisfaction and understanding when using the chatbot as a supplementary learning tool.
The automated requirement analysis process significantly reduced the time needed for initial chatbot deployment.

# Further research

- Explore the integration of additional computational libraries and topics to expand the chatbot's capabilities beyond Numpy.
- Investigate the use of adaptive learning algorithms to tailor responses based on individual student learning styles and performance.
- Propose a longitudinal study to assess the long-term impact of AI-driven chatbots on student learning outcomes in STEM fields.
